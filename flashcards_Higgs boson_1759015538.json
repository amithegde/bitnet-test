      {
        "question": "What are the properties of the Higgs boson?",
        "answer": "The Higgs boson is a massive scalar boson that couples to particles whose mass arises from their interactions with the Higgs Field. It has zero spin, even (positive) parity, no electric charge, and no colour charge."

      {
        "question": "What is the significance of the Higgs boson's stability?",
        "answer": "The Higgs boson's instability means it decays into other particles almost immediately, which is an important aspect of the Standard Model."
